# SynchronizationProject
Multi-GPU Synchronization
By Omri Steinberg-Tatman and Jackson Vaughn

On this GitHub page is the research project we performed together about the use of synchronization for running machine learning models on multiple GPUs.

We hope to have a paper published soon and will keep this README updated! 
Please reach out with any questions and comments.

With this project, we gave a presentation, and the slides for that can be found [HERE](https://github.com/wzardomri/SynchronizationProject/blob/main/ProjectPresentation.pdf)

The relevant weight saves and output data frames can be found here [HERE](https://github.com/wzardomri/SynchronizationProject/tree/main/SaveData)

The notebooks used to run the code can be found here [HERE](https://github.com/wzardomri/SynchronizationProject/tree/main/Notebooks)
